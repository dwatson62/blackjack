## Synopsis

Blackjack in Angular. Currently it is one player against the dealer. Player can bet different amounts, hit, stand, double down or split and win extra for a blackjack. Dealer knows to stand on 17 and hit up to 16. Currently one deck is used at a time, a card gets removed from the pack when chosen and gets shuffled once there is less than 12 cards left.
